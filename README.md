# Northwind Traders – Power BI Sales Performance Dashboard

## Project Overview

The Northwind Traders Power BI Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales performance, customer behavior, and employee efficiency to support data-driven business decisions.

By consolidating data from multiple tables (Sales, Customers, Orders, Products, Employees, and Regions), this interactive dashboard delivers real-time insights into revenue trends, customer segmentation, inventory distribution, and operational efficiency.

The report is designed to help Northwind Traders unlock growth opportunities, improve sales strategies, and optimize logistics through visually appealing and user-friendly visualizations.

## Objectives
- Deliver an interactive and visually intuitive dashboard for stakeholders.
- Track key performance metrics like revenue, sales trends, customer activity, and shipper performance.
- Identify high-value customers, top-performing products, and profitable regions.
- Enable informed decision-making to enhance market competitiveness in the wholesale sector.
